### Voja : the simplest progress tracker

Voja is a basic progress-tracker with a wide range of uses from tracking exam preparation to project benchmarks. The best part is the factors, which let you divide your topic into further parts and track separately. Visual representation is simple yet detailed, so you know exactly how much you have accomplished, and how much is yet left.

### DistinctFeatures

# `track factors seperately`
#  `notes & tasks to write things on the go`
# `pre-made templates to save a lot of time`
#  `simple and minimal interface`
# `store data on your device`
